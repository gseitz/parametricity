Types Are Documentation

Slides for a presentation, with specific reference to the morality of fast &
loose reasoning[1^] and obtaining theorems for free[2^].

The goal of this presentation is to demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of
reasoning about and comprehending source code using types. Some type system
implementations include properties that diminish the overall reliability and 
this point is a primary one that is addressed directly.
